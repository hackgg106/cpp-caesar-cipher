# Caesar Cipher in C++

This is a beginner-level C++ project that implements a simple **Caesar Cipher** for encrypting and decrypting text.

## Features
- Encrypts and decrypts text using a user-defined key
- Validates numeric input and prevents invalid keys
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters
- Menu-driven interface for repeated usage

## Concepts Practiced
- String manipulation
- Character handling
- Modular arithmetic
- Functions and control flow
- Input validation and error handling

## How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts alphabetic characters by a given key using modulo 26 arithmetic.  
Decryption is done by reversing the key value.

## Motivation
This project was created as part of my learning journey in C++ to better understand encryption logic and text processing.

## Future Improvements
- Better modular design
- File input/output support
- Cleaner input handling
- Unit tests

## Author
Computer science student learning C++ and actively seeking internship opportunities.
