# Caesar Cipher

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the classical Caesar cipher
for educational purposes. The project focuses on understanding basic
encryption and decryption mechanisms using modular arithmetic.

## Objectives
- Understand classical substitution ciphers
- Apply modular arithmetic in cryptography
- Practice clean and structured implementation

## Features
- Encryption with configurable shift
- Decryption of ciphertext
- Simple and readable implementation

## Technologies
- C++

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for learning and academic exploration only.
The Caesar cipher is not secure and should not be used in real-world
applications.
## Future Improvements
- Better modular design
- File input/output support
- Cleaner input handling
- Unit tests

## Author
Computer science student learning C++ and actively seeking internship opportunities.
